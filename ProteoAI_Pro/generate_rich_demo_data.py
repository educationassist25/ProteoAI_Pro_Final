"""
generate_rich_demo_data.py - A richer, standalone example dataset for ProteoAI Pro
(and for general exploration outside the app), distinct from make_sample_data.py's
simpler 4-group demos.

Produces three files:
  1. sample_protein_intensity_matrix_richdemo.csv  - 200 proteins x 43 samples
  2. sample_metadata_richdemo.csv          - 43 samples x clinical/demographic variables
  3. protein_row_annotations_richdemo.csv - 200 proteins x Gene/Method/Pathway

Design:
  - 4 Diagnosis groups (Healthy Control, Prediabetic, Type 2 Diabetes, Metabolic
    Syndrome) x 9 biological samples each = 36, + 6 QC replicates + 1 pooled
    Reference_Pool channel = 43 total. "Diagnosis" doubles as the "Group" column
    the app's stats/PCA/ANOVA logic reads, so this drops straight into ProteoAI
    Pro's single-dataset upload with no changes needed -- Age/Gender/Treatment/
    Ethnicity/Body Weight ride along as extra columns the app simply passes
    through.
  - Reference_Pool is a pooled/bridge channel (Group="Reference", IsQC=False) so
    the dataset works out of the box for TMT's reference-channel normalization,
    not just Label-Free's Median-IQR path -- select it in the Normalization tab
    regardless of which quantification method you pick in Tab 1.
  - Proteins use REAL gene symbols (via demo_gene_symbols.GENE_SYMBOLS, the same
    curated metabolic-syndrome/diabetes/lipid/inflammation-themed panel used by
    make_sample_data.py) so GSEA and P-P Interaction return genuine results against
    the real STRING/Enrichr APIs. Protein uses the UniProt "entry name" convention
    (GENE_HUMAN); Gene is the plain symbol, included both in the main matrix and in
    the row-annotation file. Proteins also carry a Method (one of 4 analysis types)
    and Pathway annotation in the row-annotation file, for external pathway-level
    interpretation, grouping, or filtering -- the app doesn't currently ingest a
    row-annotation file for that purpose, so Method/Pathway are supplementary
    reference data, not something app.py reads (Gene IS read, from the main matrix).
  - Abundance values are realistic-ish: a lognormal per-protein baseline, small
    per-sample technical noise, a shared per-pathway "activity" factor per sample
    (so proteins in the same pathway co-vary -- meaningful for correlation
    analysis), diagnosis-driven fold changes on a differential subset (meaningful
    for ANOVA/heatmap/PCA separation), and a continuous Age/Body-Weight-linked
    effect on a small subset (meaningful for correlation against continuous
    covariates). Reference_Pool is computed as the average of the true biological
    samples (with small technical noise on top) after all of that, since a pooled
    reference reflects the whole cohort rather than any one patient's biology.
    Missingness is injected with the same tiered scheme as the other demos (QC and
    Reference_Pool excluded, matching real-world high reproducibility for both),
    so Data Cleaning & Imputation has something to do.
